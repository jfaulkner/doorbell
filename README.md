Raspberry Pi screaming doorbell

I used speaker wire to connect a doorbell to GND and GPIO 23 so that whenever someone pressed the doorbell, the python script detected the action on the circuit and played a sound from the list through a pair of speakers. Once the electronics and code were working, I removed my doorbell, taped off the existing wires, and connected my speaker wire to the doorbell. Hide the speakers in a nearby bush or pumpkin, turn on your halloween lights, crank the volume, and wait for trick-or-treaters.
